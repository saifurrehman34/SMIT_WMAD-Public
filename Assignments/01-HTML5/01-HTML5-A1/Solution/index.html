        <P align="justify">This is a paragraph demonstrating various text styles. You can use <strong>bold</strong> text
            to emphasize important points, and <i>italic</i> text for titles or foreign words. Here, we can also
            <u>underline</u> specific words for additional emphasis.

        <p align="justify">In programming, you might encounter inline code snippets like var <var>x = 10</var>;, which
            show how to declare a variable in JavaScript. The <var>x</var> variable can be used later in your code. If
            you need to represent keyboard shortcuts, you might use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste text.</p>

            <h3>Section One: Understanding HTML Elements</h3>
            <p align="justify">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It
                consists of a series of elements that describe the structure of a webpage. Each element is defined by
                tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, a paragraph is defined using the
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">Each element can also have attributes that provide additional information. For example,
                an image tag might look like this: <code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"&gt;</code>. Here,
                <code>src</code> specifies the image source, and <code>alt</code> provides an alternative text
                description.
            </p>

            <h3>Section Two: The Importance of Semantic HTML</h3>
            <p align="justify">Using semantic HTML elements helps search engines understand the content of your webpage
                better. Elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;,&lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;</code>
                clearly define the different parts of a webpage. This not only aids in SEO but also improves
                accessibility for users relying on screen readers.

                elements. With CSS, you can change the color, font, spacing, and positioning of elements on the For

background-color: #f0f0f0;
color: #333;
}
                 </code></pre>

            <p>This simple CSS rule changes the background color of the entire page and sets the text color to a darker
                shade for better readability.</p>
